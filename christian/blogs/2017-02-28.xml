  What a busy day! Christian Union's Tuesday Night Training kicked off for the semester tonight.
  I was lucky enough to be able to attend this, although for the remainder of the semester I'll have to attend my masters unit Lab.
  Met a heap of new faces at TNT, specifically new studetns Elliot, Chris, Darren, Luke.

  I feel I haven't blogged much so I'm taking this oppertunity to note a couple personal things that have happened to me.
  I'm still struggling to get into routine of reading my bible. It takes alot of work to get good practises.
  At CU tonight, I was informed by a friend that I shouldn't worry about differences with friends or partners around things like creationism.
  His argument was that as a Christian, I expect God to be the key factor in peoples lives, not necessarily myself.
  Ie, If I was seeking a girlfriend/wife that followed God but had to be an evolutionist for the purposes of ministry in an academic environment,
  then perhaps I'm missing the point that it's Gods work regardless of the opinion. And I can relate to this because I certainly
  have a tendancy to think that I know what is best. But is is such a trivial thing. I actually admire a little bit the idea that
  an individual can have such faith in a literal translation of the bible and its message of grace and hope.

  Tom has also encouraged me to read the article that Joash previously gave me, on fine-tuning.
  I see this as something that is quite important, but I haven't even looked at yet getting caught up in other things.

  And as for daily bible readings, well here we go:
